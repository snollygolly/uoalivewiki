<p>This may sound silly to mention but this server is heavily moderated by it's player-base and staff to be a safe community for all. What does that mean? It means what happens in game stays in game.<br><br>We want you to come here after a long day of work and spend your time enjoying what the timeless world of Ultima Online has to offer you, not worry about who said what, when, and where. We do not and will not tolerate discrimination again gender, sexual orientation, religion, or just using whatever semblance of Internet anonymity you may be holding onto to create a toxic environment. "Ain't nobody got time fo' dat!"&nbsp;<br><br>We are all here for the same reason: to play the game, in the game, with the mechanics it provides. Not PvP on forums, discord chat, or other social media outlets. We take this very seriously. It is something that plagues the game world and Ultima Online in particular. We aim to rise above it!</p>
