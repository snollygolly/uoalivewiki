<h4><strong>BRITCOIN(BTC) is a simple currency</strong>, you acquire it by… being logged into the game. So not unlike real "bitcoin"... spending your electricity by playing UOAlive... who said you COULDN’T mine crypto while playing UO.<br><br>So you acquire these just by being logged in and doing anything in the world, but when you log out, why not leave your character hanging out in a "blessed areas", this not only gives you a bonus to BRITCOINS acquired but allows others to marvel at your amazing character standing proud to support UOAlive. This currency will slowly accrue in your bank account, type [wallet to see it.</h4>
