<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>Is your house not enough? Do you wish you had a fortified town with walls around it? Do you just want that special deco item for your tavern?</strong></p>
<h1 style="text-align:center;"><strong>We can make it happen with a Surveyor John Project!</strong></h1>
<h3 style="text-align:center;"><strong>All interactions with Surveyor John will be in character, and he is a feisty, drunken, washed up pirate… with a knack for booze, gold, wenches, and labor if it isn't his own. But he sure does get the job done!</strong></h3>

<p style="text-align:center;"><i><strong>Just an update we no longer offer the Yard tool as it was buggier than all get out. All projects must go through the Surveyor!</strong></i></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>Any blessing for a player town or even your own personal home will require you to gather resources for it and/or complete a series of quests.</strong></p>
<h2><br><strong>CUSTOM DESIGNS:</strong></h2>
<p><strong>We will entertain ANY ideas you come up with</strong>,</p>
<ul>
  <li>Walls</li>
  <li>Moats</li>
  <li>Docks</li>
  <li>Gateways</li>
  <li>Buildings</li>
  <li>A park</li>
  <li>A small bench and some trees(think big, or think cozy)</li>
  <li>A special item in your home turned tavern</li>
</ul>
<p>But it will require <strong>you </strong>to put in the <strong>work </strong>for it.</p>
<h2><strong>Let's throw out an example.</strong></h2>
<p>&nbsp;You have a castle and want to fill the insides walls with water, you will need to complete a series of objectives, quests, resource gathering missions that will be determined by a Game Master/Surveyor. Once you have all the resources and/or completed all quests, the work will begin. In this case it would most likely have to do with the High Seas content.</p>
<p>Once work is complete, to maintain that work you will need to pay a tax for upkeep.</p>
<h2><strong>Example 2:</strong></h2>
<p>You want to build a wall around your tiny home because you made some enemies, you will be required to go and gather the lumber required for such a build and it will depend on size, location, tree type, wall type, etc.</p>
<p>This should really expand your ability to role-play, create the perfect town with friends, that tavern you always wanted to run in the middle of the ocean, or just spice up your front lawn.</p>
<p><strong>We think this will be an amazing addition to the game and if you need suggestions, we will send a surveyor to your property to let you know some of what they feel your options may be.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Limitations: Open a ticket with your proposal prior to make sure you are good to begin your <u>personal</u> project. Group projects and towns etc cannot be requested to be blessed. Staff will recognize good work and reward it from activity and how it benefits the community.</strong></p>

<p><i>Any blessings already in game will be grandfathered in.</i></p>
