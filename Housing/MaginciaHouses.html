<p>A long time ago, there were plots you could use a lottery system to get houses in New Magincia both in Trammel and Felucca. Well... NO MORE!</p>
<p>We have made a massive purchase of the the land owners and stopped their greed. You can now place houses freely in the plots. There area a limited amount so get yours while you can!</p>
<p>This is a UOAlive custom feature.</p>
