<p><strong>Launcher</strong> : A program that helps a user locate and start other computer programs. During setup, you will make use of the official launchers briefly to patch your client's files, and then you will make use of a separate launch-assistant program to open and play the game in the future. <sup><a href="#ref10">[10]</a></sup> <br>
              <br>
              <strong>Launch-assistant</strong> : Our term for a program that allows the user to connect to private/unofficial UO servers. These often include additional features such as macros, hotkeys, auto-looters, and more QoL features. When playing on the UOAlive server, you will open your chosen launch-assistant program when you want to play the game. <sup><a href="#ref1">[1]</a></sup> <sup><a href="#ref2">[2]</a></sup> <sup><a href="#ref3">[3]</a></sup> <sup><a href="#ref4">[4]</a></sup> <sup><a href="#ref5">[5]</a></sup> <sup><a href="#ref7">[7]</a></sup> <sup><a href="#ref8">[8]</a></sup> <sup><a href="#ref9">[9]</a></sup> <br>
              <br>
        <strong>Client</strong> : A program that is used to connect to a UO server. Simply put, this is how you access the game. If you were playing on the Official servers, you would simply open the Classic or Enhanced client and login from there, however to play on UOAlive, you will need an Assistant Program. <sup><a href="#ref6">[6]</a></sup> </p>

        <h1>Choosing Your Setup</h1>
        <p>
            The below tabs will allow you to view the different features each client and launch-assistant has so that you
            can select which ones you wish to use for your gameplay. You can click through each tab to read the
            description of each component, and you will be provided with installation instructions once you have chosen
            a viable combination. You can also have multiple installations on your system at once, but this guide should
            help you pick functional combinations to experiment with. Remember, you can always download a new setup, so
            don't feel like you are tied down to your first choice if you want to change!

                            support for modern devices in the form of zooming, FPS controls, and custom gumps among others.

                                    Razor Enhanced is an updated version of Razor using .Net 4.5. It is faster, less likely
                                    to crash, and includes new specialized agents such as auto-loot, scavenger, and better
                                    targeting. It also makes use of a Python-based macro system, which should be much easier
                                    for the average user to use. This launch-assistant also includes a UOSteam-mimic script
                                    engine, which should increase compatibility between the two programs' macro scripts.
                                    (NOTE: This program is still in Beta, and as such should be expected to have
                                    imperfections that may impair the player's experience).

                                <h3>Step 1: The Client</h3>
                                <ul class="step-descriptions">
                                    <li>Firstly, the Classic Client will need to be downloaded from the official site <a href="https://uo.com/getting-started/">here</a> by clicking the image that looks like this:</li>
                                    <li class="no-deco"><img src="https://uoalive.com/images/UO_Clients_Classic_Download.PNG" alt="An image of the download link for the Classic Client." width="250"></li>
                                    <li>Once the Client is downloaded, open the downloaded executable to start the installation process</li>
                                    <li>Follow the steps as presented in the installation wizard, and you may want to make note of where the client is being saved to for later steps</li>
                                    <li class="no-deco"><img src="https://uoalive.com/images/UO_Clients_Classic_Install.PNG" alt="An image of the Classic Client's installation wizard." width="300"></li>
                                    <li>Once the installation is finished, you will want to launch the client either using the shortcut created during installation, or you can look in the folder it was saved to for the client.exe file, as well</li>
                                    <li>When the client is launched, the patcher will begin. Let the client patch fully but DO NOT click play once it is complete</li>
                                    <li class="no-deco"><img src="https://uoalive.com/images/UO_Clients_Classic_Patch.PNG" alt="An image of the Classic Client's patcher upon completion." width="400"></li>
                                </ul>
                                <h3>Step 2: The Launch-assistant(s)</h3>
                                <ul class="step-descriptions">
                                    <li>Now that the Client is ready, you will need to download the ClassicUO launch-assistant program <a href="https://www.classicuo.eu/">here</a> using the link that corresponds to your operating system (likely Windowsx64):</li>
                                    <li class="no-deco"><img src="https://uoalive.com/images/UO_Launchssistants_ClassicUO_Download.PNG" alt="An image of the download link for ClassicUO." width="450"></li>
                                    <li>Once the download has finished, the files will need to be extracted using a file archiving tool such as <a href="https://www.rarlab.com/">WinRAR</a> or <a href="https://www.7-zip.org/">7-Zip</a> instead of using an installation wizard</li>
                                    <li>You may want to make note of where ClassicUO is being saved to for later steps</li>
                                    <li>Next, make sure that you have the latest version of VC++ by going to <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-US/cpp/windows/latest-supported-vc-redist">this</a> page and downloading the version that corresponds to your architecture (likely x64)</li>
                                    <li class="no-deco"><img src="https://uoalive.com/images/UO_Launchssistants_ClassicUO_VC++_Download.PNG" alt="An image of the download link for VC++ needed for ClassicUO." width="400"></li>
                                    <li>You will then need to run the downloaded executable to install the VC++ update properly</li>
                                    <li class="no-deco"><img src="https://uoalive.com/images/UO_Launchssistants_ClassicUO_VC++_Install.PNG" alt="An image of the VC++ installation wizard." width="400"></li>
                                    <li>Razor Enhanced is also needed for this setup, and as such needs to be downloaded from <a href="https://razorenhanced.net/">here</a> using the link shown below:</li>
                                    <li class="no-deco"><img src="https://uoalive.com/images/UO_Launchssistants_RazorEnhanced_Download.PNG" alt="An image of the download link for Razor Enhanced." width="450"></li>
                                    <li>Once the download has finished, the files will need to be extracted using a file archiving tool such as <a href="https://www.rarlab.com/">WinRAR</a> or <a href="https://www.7-zip.org/">7-Zip</a> instead of using an installation wizard</li>
                                    <li>You may want to make note of where Razor Enhanced is being saved to for later steps</li>
                                    <li>Once the launcher is extracted, you will want to launch ClassicUO either using the shortcut created during installation, or you can look in the folder it was saved to for the ClassicUOLauncher.exe file, as well</li>
                                </ul>
                                <h3>Step 3: Configuration</h3>
                                <ul class="step-descriptions">
                                    <li>At this point, all you need to do is point ClassicUO to your client, Razor, and the server itself</li>
                                    <li>Start by clicking the "Create First Profile" or "Open Profile Editor" button, click "Add", and enter your desired profile name</li>
                                    <li>You can select the UOAlive Preset to enter some of the information for you, including the server IP <strong><em>(login.uoalive.com)</em></strong> and port <strong><em>(2593)</em></strong></li>
                                    <li>Make sure that the "Use Encryption" option is unclicked, and the UO Path section should be set to the folder that holds your Classic Client installation's files (you may want to use your saved pathway here if you noted it earlier), at which point your profile should look similar to the image below, although your pathways may be slightly different</li>
                                    <li class="no-deco"><img src="https://uoalive.com/images/UO_Launchssistants_ClassicUO_Config_1.PNG" alt="An image of the ClassicUO launcher with the correct information in place to play on UOAlive." width="400"></li>
                                    <li>In order to add Razor Enhanced, you will first need to copy or cut the folder containing your Razor Enhanced installation and paste it into your ClassicUO/Data/Plugins folder</li>
                                    <li>Now, move to the Plugins tab, and click "Add" to point towards your Razor Enhanced installation (this may be another time to use a saved filepath from earlier), at which point your launcher should look similar to the image below:</li>
                                    <li class="no-deco"><img src="https://uoalive.com/images/UO_Launchssistants_ClassicUO_Config_2.PNG" alt="Another image of the ClassicUO launcher with the correct information in place to play on UOAlive." width="400"></li>
                                    <li>Finally, you can click the "Save Profile" button, then the "Play!" button to launch the game window</li>
                                </ul>
                                <h3>Step 4: Account Creation</h3>
                                <ul class="step-descriptions">
                                    <li>Once the UO login window appears, you may enter any unused username and password
                                        (under 12 characters) combination and click the "Login" button. This will create
                                        your account, and you will use this username and password whenever you play on UO
                                        Alive, so you may want to make note of it somewhere secure.</li>
                                    <li class="no-deco"><img src="https://uoalive.com/images/UO_Launchssistants_ClassicUO_Play.PNG" alt="An image of the ClassicUO login screen." width="600"></li>
                                    <li>NOTE: Your forum account and game account are separate, and although you may use the same name, changing your forum password will not change the password you use to play the game. In order to change you game account's password, you may open a ticket on the UO Alive Discord.</li>

                                    Razor is a great tool for beginners, given its user-friendly interface and macro system.
                                    It also has some differences when compared to UOSteam (which in many ways replaced this
                                    tool for more experienced users). In particular, it is slightly faster at some niche
                                    actions in macros (although it has a more limited macro system), and it has a simple
                                    screenshot and in-game recording functionality.
                                    <br><br>
                                    NOTE: ClassicUO tends to experience a lot of bugs when using the traditional Razor tool,
                                    and as such, UO Alive recommends the use of Razor Community Edition for this particular
                                    configuration. This tool has built on top of the source code of the original Razor that
                                    was released in 2014, and includes improved scripting functionalities alongside in-game
                                    commands using scripting syntax. Aside from these differences, though, users should
                                    have a similar experience with this launch-assistant as traditional Razor.

                                    <li>Once the download has finished, the files will need to be extracted using a file archiving tool such as <a href="https://www.rarlab.com/">WinRAR</a> or <a href="https://www.7-zip.org/">7-Zip</a> instead of using an installation wizard</li>
                                    <li>You may want to make note of where ClassicUO is being saved to for later steps</li>
                                    <li>Next, make sure that you have the latest version of VC++ by going to <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-US/cpp/windows/latest-supported-vc-redist">this</a> page and downloading the version that corresponds to your architecture (likely x64)</li>
                                    <li class="no-deco"><img src="https://uoalive.com/images/UO_Launchssistants_ClassicUO_VC++_Download.PNG" alt="An image of the download link for VC++ needed for ClassicUO." width="400"></li>
                                    <li>You will then need to run the downloaded executable to install the VC++ update properly</li>
                                    <li class="no-deco"><img src="https://uoalive.com/images/UO_Launchssistants_ClassicUO_VC++_Install.PNG" alt="An image of the VC++ installation wizard." width="400"></li>
                                    <li>Razor Community Edition is also needed for this setup, and as such needs to be downloaded from <a href="https://www.razorce.com/download/">here</a> by clicking the most recent download link on the site itself, and then downloading the .zip file with the cube symbol to the left of it on the Github page as shown below:</li>
                                    <li class="no-deco"><img src="https://uoalive.com/images/UO_Launchassistants_RazorCommunityEd_Download.PNG" alt="An image of the download link for Razor Community Edition on the official web site." width="400"></li>

                                    <li>Once the download has finished, the files will need to be extracted using a file archiving tool similarly to the ClassicUO files mentioned above</li>
                                    <li>As with the ClassicUO files, you may want to make note of where Razor Community Edition is extracted to for later steps</li>
                                </ul>
                                <h3>Step 3: Configuration</h3>
                                <ul class="step-descriptions">
                                    <li>At this point, all you need to do is point ClassicUO to your client, Razor Community Edition, and the server itself</li>
                                    <li>Start by clicking the "Create First Profile" or "Open Profile Editor" button, click "Add", and enter your desired profile name</li>
                                    <li>You can select the UOAlive Preset to enter some of the information for you, including the server IP <strong><em>(login.uoalive.com)</em></strong> and port <strong><em>(2593)</em></strong></li>
                                    <li>Make sure that the "Use Encryption" option is unclicked, and the UO Path section should be set to the folder that holds your Classic Client installation's files (you may want to use your saved pathway here if you noted it earlier), at which point your profile should look similar to the image below, although your pathways may be slightly different</li>

                                    <li>In order to add Razor Community Edition, you will first need to copy or cut the folder containing your Razor Community Edition installation and paste it into your ClassicUO/Data/Plugins folder</li>
                                    <li>Now, move to the Plugins tab, and click "Add" to point towards your relocated Razor Community Edition installation, at which point your launcher should look similar to the image below:</li>

                                    <li>Finally, you can click the "Save Profile" button, then the "Play!" button to launch the game window</li>
                                </ul>
                                <h3>Step 4: Account Creation</h3>
                                <ul class="step-descriptions">
                                    <li>Once the UO login window appears, you may enter any unused username and password
                                        (under 12 characters) combination and click the "Login" button. This will create
                                        your account, and you will use this username and password whenever you play on UO
                                        Alive, so you may want to make note of it somewhere secure.</li>

                            There is an alternative version of ClassicUO that runs in a web browser that is currently in
                            Beta. This is effectively the same as a normal installation of ClassicUO, however it is hosted
                            remotely which both reduces the amount of configuration necessary on the user's behalf, as well
                            as the storage required. This tool is, however, still in development, and as such there is
                            currently no assistant program for macros (although one is in development that will be similar
                            to Razor), and the global map is currently unavailable.

                            <li>Firstly, this client requires the user to be using Chrome 99+ (which can be assured by updating to the most recent version of Chrome).

                            <li>Users should ensure that they also have a few GB of unused memory, as once they connect for the first time, some files will be downloaded, although they will not require user intervention</li>

                                    Razor is a great tool for beginners, given its user-friendly interface and macro system.
                                    It also has some differences when compared to UOSteam (which in many ways replaced this
                                    tool for more experienced users). In particular, it is slightly faster at some niche
                                    actions in macros (although it has a more limited macro system), and it has a simple

                                    than some other options).

                                    <li>Firstly, the Classic Client will need to be downloaded from the official site <a href="https://uo.com/getting-started/">here</a> by clicking the image that looks like this:</li>

                                    <li>Once the installation is finished, you will want to launch the client either using the shortcut created during installation, or you can look in the folder it was saved to for the client.exe file, as well</li>
                                    <li>When the client is launched, the patcher will begin. Let the client patch fully but DO NOT click play once it is complete</li>

                                    <li>Once the installation is finished, you will want to launch Razor either using the shortcut created during installation, or you can look in the folder it was saved to for the Razor.exe file, as well</li>

                                    <li>At this point, all you need to do is point Razor to your client and the server itself</li>

                                    <li>Once all of this is done, your launcher should look similar to the image below, although your pathways may be slightly different</li>

                                    Razor Enhanced is an updated version of Razor using .Net 4.5. It is faster, less likely
                                    to crash, and includes new specialized agents such as auto-loot, scavenger, and better
                                    targeting. It also makes use of a Python-based macro system, which should be much easier
                                    for the average user to use. This launch-assistant also includes a UOSteam-mimic script
                                    engine, which should increase compatibility between the two programs' macro scripts.
                                    (NOTE: This program is still in Beta, and as such should be expected to have

                                    <li>Firstly, the Classic Client will need to be downloaded from the official site <a href="https://uo.com/getting-started/">here</a> by clicking the image that looks like this:</li>

                                    <li>When the client is launched, the patcher will begin. Let the client patch fully but DO NOT click play once it is complete</li>

                            <li>Once the installation is finished, you will want to launch UOSteam either using the shortcut created during installation, or you can look in the folder it was saved to for the UOS.exe file, as well</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h3>Step 3: Configuration</h3>
                        <ul class="step-descriptions">
                            <li>At this point, all you need to do is point UOSteam to your client and the server itself</li>
                            <li>Start by editing the Client Options section, and change it to the client.exe file from your classic client installation (you may want to use your saved pathway here if you noted it earlier)</li>
                            <li>You will use the same pathway for the Ultima Online section, however you will only point to the folder that holds your client.exe and other files instead of the file itself</li>
                            <li>At this point, you will need to enter the shard address <strong><em>(login.uoalive.com)</em></strong> and port <strong><em>(2593)</em></strong>, and you will need to make sure that remove encryption is checked</li>
                            <li>Once all of this is done, your launcher should look similar to the image below, although your pathways may be slightly different</li>

                            <li>Finally, you can click the "Start" button, make sure the "Negotiate features with server" option is checked, and launch the game window</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h3>Step 4: Account Creation</h3>

                            <li>Once the UO login window appears, you may enter any unused username and password
                                (under 12 characters) combination and click the "Login" button. This will create
                                your account, and you will use this username and password whenever you play on UO
                                Alive, so you may want to make note of it somewhere secure.</li>

                            OrionUO is a launch-assistant program that is similar to ClassicUO in many ways, but it does not
                            work with Razor, Razor Enhanced, or UOSteam. One potential advantage of this option is its
                            JavaScript macro system, which may be more familiar (or else easier to find references for)
                            than some of the other tools' more unique scripting languages.

                        <p>Follow the steps below in order to set up your device to play on UO Alive:</p>
                        <h3>Step 1: The Client</h3>
                        <ul class="step-descriptions">
                            <li>Firstly, the Classic Client will need to be downloaded from the official site <a href="https://uo.com/getting-started/">here</a> by clicking the image that looks like this:</li>
                            <li class="no-deco"><img src="https://uoalive.com/images/UO_Clients_Classic_Download.PNG" alt="An image of the download link for the Classic Client." width="250"></li>
                            <li>Once the Client is downloaded, open the downloaded executable to start the installation process</li>
                            <li>Follow the steps as presented in the installation wizard, and you may want to make note of where the client is being saved to for later steps</li>

                            <li>Once the installation is finished, you will want to launch the client either using the shortcut created during installation, or you can look in the folder it was saved to for the client.exe file, as well</li>
                            <li>When the client is launched, the patcher will begin. Let the client patch fully but DO NOT click play once it is complete</li>

                        </ul>
                        <h3>Step 2: The Launch-assistant</h3>
                        <ul class="step-descriptions">
                            <li>Now that the Client is ready, you will need to download the OrionUO launch-assistant program <a href="http://orionuo.online/">here</a> using the link that corresponds to your operating system (likely Windowsx64):</li>

                            <li>Once the download has finished, open the downloaded executable to start the installation process</li>
                            <li>Follow the steps as presented in the installation wizard, and you may want to make note of where OrionUO is being saved to for later steps</li>

                            <li>Once the installation is finished, you will want to launch OrionUO either using the shortcut created during installation, or you can look in the folder it was saved to for the OrionLauncher[YourVersionHere].exe file (Likely OrionLauncher64.exe), as well</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h3>Step 3: Configuration</h3>
                        <ul class="step-descriptions">
                            <li>At this point, all you need to do is point OrionUO to your client and the server itself</li>
                            <li>Start by pointing towards the client.exe file from your classic client installation (you may want to use your saved pathway here if you noted it earlier) in order to determine the client version using the "FROM CLIENT.EXE FILE" option during setup</li>
                            <li>You will then click "Create" to save this version in your launcher before closing the client version configuration windows</li>
                            <li>In the UO Files Path section, target the folder that contains your classic client installation</li>
                            <li>Next, you will edit the Orion Path section so that it targets the folder that you installed OrionUO to</li>
                            <li>You will need to move to the Updates tab if not already there, and you will want to Check Updates and Apply Updates before continuing</li>
                            <li>Next, you will return to the Profile tab, and you can rename the server to UOAlive. Then, click the "Default Profile" and click "Edit Profile"</li>
                            <li>At this point, you will need to enter a profile name (which can be your character, account, or server name depending on your preferences), as well as the shard address <strong><em>(login.uoalive.com)</em></strong> and port <strong><em>(2593)</em></strong> (Which for this launch-assistant need to be formatted as <strong><em>"login.uoalive.com,2593"</em></strong>)</li>
                            <li>Once all of this is done, your launcher should look similar to the image below, although your pathways may be slightly different</li>

                            <li>Finally, you can click the "Launch" button and launch the game window</li>

                            configuration process, as well as a Razor-esque script functionality. Due to its use of OpenGL
                            and SDL2, users may experience slight performance improvements over other launch-assistants,
                            as long as their device is compatible.

                    The Enhanced Client is a more recent version of the UO client that more closely resembles other modern
                    MMOs. This client is notable for its enhanced graphics, more robust radar, visible macro bar, and more
                    customizable interfaces. If you want to play UO in a way that is more familiar to modern MMO fans, this
                    may be the choice for you! However most people do find themselve drawn to the Classic Client with the 
					Classic UO Launcher as they learn the game better. Good news is you can have both installed at once!

                This Client requires the use of a specialized launch-assistant program due to the differences between it
                and the Classic Client.

                <h3>Step 1: The Client</h3>
                <ul class="step-descriptions">
                    <li>Firstly, the Enhanced Client will need to be downloaded from the official site <a href="https://uo.com/getting-started/">here</a> by clicking the image that looks like this:</li>
                    <li class="no-deco"><img src="https://uoalive.com/images/UO_Clients_Enhanced_Download.PNG" alt="An image of the download link for the Enhanced Client." width="250"></li>
                    <li>Once the Client is downloaded, open the downloaded executable to start the installation process</li>
                    <li>Follow the steps as presented in the installation wizard, and you may want to make note of where the client is being saved to for later steps</li>
                    <li class="no-deco"><img src="https://uoalive.com/images/UO_Clients_Enhanced_Install.PNG" alt="An image of the Enhanced Client's installation wizard." width="300"></li>
                    <li>Once the installation is finished, you will want to launch the client either using the shortcut created during installation, or you can look in the folder it was saved to for the uopatch.exe file, as well</li>
                    <li>When the client is launched, the patcher will begin. Let the client patch fully but DO NOT click play once it is complete</li>
                    <li class="no-deco"><img src="https://uoalive.com/images/UO_Clients_Enhanced_Patch.PNG" alt="An image of the Enhanced Client's patcher upon completion." width="400"></li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Step 2: The Launch-assistant</h3>
                <ul class="step-descriptions">
                    <li>Now that the Client is ready, you will need to download the Enhanced Launcher launch-assistant program by right-clicking save as on <a href="https://uoalive.com/ECLauncherSetup.rar">this link</a></li>
                    <li>Once the download has finished, open the downloaded executable to start the installation process</li>
                    <li>Follow the steps as presented in the installation wizard, and you may want to make note of where the Enhanced Launcher is being saved to for later steps</li>
                    <li class="no-deco"><img src="https://uoalive.com/images/UO_Launchssistants_EnhancedClient_Install.PNG" alt="An image of Enhanced Client Launcher's installation wizard." width="300"></li>
                    <li>Once the installation is finished, you will want to launch the Enhanced Launcher either using the shortcut created during installation, or you can look in the folder it was saved to for the UOECLauncher.exe file, as well</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Step 3: Configuration</h3>
                <ul class="step-descriptions">
                    <li>At this point, all you need to do is point the Enhanced Launcher to your client and the server itself</li>
                    <li>Start by editing the UO:SA Client Path section, and change it to the folder that holds your enhanced client installation's files (you may want to use your saved pathway here if you noted it earlier)</li>
                    <li>At this point, you will need to enter the server address <strong><em>(login.uoalive.com)</em></strong> and port <strong><em>(2593)</em></strong></li>
                    <li>Once all of this is done, your launcher should look similar to the image below, although your pathways may be slightly different</li>
                    <li class="no-deco"><img src="https://uoalive.com/images/UO_Launchssistants_EnhancedClient_Config.PNG" alt="An image of the Enhanced Client Launcher with the correct information in place to play on UOAlive." width="300"></li>
                    <li>Finally, you can click the "Play" button and launch the game window</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Step 4: Account Creation</h3>
                <ul class="step-descriptions">
                    <li>Once the UO login window appears, you may enter any unused username and password
                        (under 12 characters) combination and click the "Login" button. This will create
                        your account, and you will use this username and password whenever you play on UO
                        Alive, so you may want to make note of it somewhere secure.</li>

        <h1>MobileUO</h1>
        It is worth noting that there is also a mobile app that can be used to connect to UO Alive, however few users
        have experience with this application, which may make it more difficult to overcome any challenges encountered.
        It also makes use of the ClassicUO Launch-assistant, however it utilizes Unity to port it to mobile. The video
        shown below explains how to configure this application, however information regarding this application is
        somewhat challenging to find, so it may require a bit of trial and error as updates come:
