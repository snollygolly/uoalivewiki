<h1 style="text-align:center;">So as we all know, the bod system is a grind from hell and makes it not fun whatsoever. So here is our solution at UOAlive!</h1>
<p style="text-align:center;">You can now purchase a Large BOD deed box from the stones in Magincia. This is considered a mid game item and is priced accordingly.</p>
<figure class="image image_resized" style="width:37.97%;"><img src="https://uoalive.com/forum/attachments/2018-10-13-03_08_44-ultima-online-tr1age-uoalive-2-0-png.260/" alt="2018-10-13 03_08_44-Ultima Online - tr1age (UOAlive 2.0).png"></figure>
<p style="text-align:center;">The Large BOD Deed box is used to give you the small bod deeds needed to complete the large bods.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">It will take gold from your bank or inventory to pay for it on use. You drop a LargeBOD into the</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">box (only one can be placed in the box at a time). Then you doubleclick the box and it'll charge</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">you the money to get the bods and your original bod back. The bods will all be placed in the box</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">so make sure to remove them. If you are using the box and put a bod in and dont have the money</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">for it and leave the bod in the box no one else can use the box till you finish with it. This</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">box can be used both in your inventory or on the ground and can be secured in your house.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>THIS IS A UOALIVE EXCLUSIVE!!</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">Fill out your Large Bod Deeds with ease!</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">Enjoy!</p>
