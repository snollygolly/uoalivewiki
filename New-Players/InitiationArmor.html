<h3>There are 2 quest NPC's that offer a set of initiation armor. They can be found in the Warrior's Area of New Haven, just south of your spawn and the bank!</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Captain Dasha</strong> for a <strong><u>human set </u>(make sure to pick properly!)</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Captain Luek</strong> for a <strong><u>gargoyle set. </u>(make sure to pick properly!)</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>All you need is to use your Young Player Ticket, which they will ask for, to turn in for a set of armor.</p>
<p>You need to accept the quest and mark your new player ticket as a quest item(left click self toggle quest item) and turn it in to get the armor.</p>
<p>You can find this in your bank when creating a new character!</p>
