<h1><strong>Insurance</strong></h1>
<ul>
  <li>You can insure most important items that are not cursed so if you die they do not fall to your corpse and will be with you upon resurrection.</li>
</ul>
<h1>Corpse Summoner</h1>
<ul>
  <li>If you do lose a body and cannot get to it in time, you can use a corpse collector for a fee in Britain to have it brought to you. You have 1 minute to loot your corpse before his minion literally eats it.</li>
</ul>
