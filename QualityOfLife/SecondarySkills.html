<h1>Additional info:</h1>
<ul>
  <li>Skills gump shows only real skills in the Real skills total, which can be easily monitored against the real skills cap. Free skills values are visible under other columns / settings in the skills gump.</li>
  <li>Buying skills from NPCs allows free skills to be purchased when over the real skills cap. Real skills can only be purchased from NPCs when the purchase would keep them under the real skills cap or if there are down-pointing real skills to offset NPC teaching gains.</li>
  <li>Scrolls of Transcendence can be used for players whose total skills are over the real skills cap. For free skills, the scroll of transcendence can always be used, as long as it keeps the skill under that individual skill's cap. For real skills, when the character is at or near the real skills cap, the scroll can be used if there are other down-pointing real skills to offset the gains. The scroll of transcendence will not be used if there are not enough down-pointing real skills to gain the transcendence level without violating the real skills cap.</li>
