<h1>Players Making History</h1>
<p>Here at UOAlive, we believe that it's the players who make the server. Each player contributes something to the world, and these contributions can often lead to fun events. Every shard has its own history, and this wiki page has been created to highlight the lore of UOAlive.</p>
<h1><strong>Player-Driven Events</strong></h1>
<ul>
  <li>Pet Fights</li>
  <li>Boat Race</li>
