<h1>Players Making History</h1>
<p>Here at UOAlive, we believe the players make the server. From daily grinds by the solo warrior to player run group events for a special tame, from building homes and agonizing over placing that daily rare artifact to stocking vendors with the best of goods at discount prices, UOAlive would not exist without its community and the effort everyone puts into it. This wiki page has been created to highlight some of the bigger occurrences in this shard and keep a log of UOAlive's server lore.</p>

<h1>In Memorium</h1>
<p>Though individual players come and go, many have made their mark on UOAlive. The following are nods to the various memorials throughout the shard meant to keep their memories alive.</p>
<ul>
