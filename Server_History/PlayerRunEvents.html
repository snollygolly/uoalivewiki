<h1><strong>Player-Driven Events</strong></h1>
<h2>Friends for Charlie</h2>
<p>This was a really cool event where a new Tamable of UOAlive <a href="https://wiki.uoalive.com/en/Tamables/Exotics/Charlie">Charlie</a> which is highly sought after but also a very difficult encounter, was turned into an event called Friends for Charlie.</p>

<p>So through this, players go together night after night and did the event together to help each other get a Charlie, even rolling at the end to see who would get the Exotic Creature! On player Mdiers was having bad rolls and had even lost one to an accidental splash damage kill of the creature itself. The players got together while the player was sleeping and ran it again, transferring it to them in the morning. This was an amazing and continues to be an amazing example of the UOAlive Community efforts!</p>
