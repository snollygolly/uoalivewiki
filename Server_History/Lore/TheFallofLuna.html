<p><i>Luna has a new mysterious figure roaming the Rune Library. Mumbling of dreams and madness under their breath whilst paging through books, and tome after tome of magic, a wandering fool or is this dream a reality? It has been said they have visited the adventurers in their travels, but yet they...</i></p>
<h2><strong>"Dreams - The Fall of Luna" Summary</strong></h2>
<p>Duma, the spirit that mumbled in riddles, had been a mysterious figure for many years. Duma riddles were rumored to hold the key to saving the city of Luna, but despite many attempts, the heroes of Sosaria could not decipher them. The valiant knights and adventurous warriors of Sosaria failed to solve Duma enigmas at every turn.</p>
<p>Their greed, however, proved to be their undoing. It transformed their dreams into horrific monsters that invaded the city of Luna time and time again, weakening it with each attack. The source of their corruption was the Rune Library, a repository of powerful magic books that held portals to every corner of the world.</p>
<p>Unaware of the library's true power, the heroes hoarded more and more books, until the magic within them erupted in a massive explosion that destroyed the city of Luna and killed everyone within a hundred miles. Smoke billowed from the ruins.</p>
<p>In the aftermath of the disaster, the Mages of Wind stepped in to help the heroes. They realized that the key to defeating Duma was not just in solving Duma riddles but in trapping Duma in a temporal time loop. That way, Duma would relive their own nightmarish dreams over and over and never know they had been defeated.</p>
<p>The heroes, now joined by the Mages of Wind, set out on their mission to defeat Duma once and for all, who had been released from Duma ties to the otherworld by the magical explosion. Even tired and worn from so many losses and the destruction of the city, their determination and bravery eventually paid off. They planned to trap Duma in a temporal time loop, so he would relive Duma dreams over and over, never realizing that they had been defeated.</p>
<p>Despite the great danger, the heroes succeeded in defeating Duma. Some left with scars that will last a lifetime.</p>
<p>The once-great city was now a corrupted dungeon, holding Duma's spirit captive so that the rest of the world could live in peace. The stakes were high, as Duma's power was too great to truly defeat, and the heroes knew that they had to remain vigilant to prevent his escape.. If the heroes were to falter, the spirit would destroy the rest of Sosaria, leaving only destruction in its wake. In the end, the heroes had saved the rest of Sosaria from Duma's wrath, but the city of Luna remained a warning of the dangers of greed and ambition.</p>
<p>The memory of what happened there would be passed down from generation to generation, serving as a reminder of what could happen if they were ever to falter again as they battle every moon to defeat the aborations of Duma again and again and again and again...</p>
<p>But the Mages of Wind did not let the heroes depart without honoring them for their bravery and unwavering dedication to protecting the realm. In a grand ceremony, the Mages of Wind bestowed upon each hero a magical talisman, symbolizing the eternal gratitude of the people of Sosaria.</p>
<p>The talismans glimmered in the light of the moon, a symbol of the heroes' bravery and sacrifice, a reminder to all of the power of courage and selflessness. The heroes were now known throughout the realm as the protectors of Sosaria, revered for their bravery and dedication.</p>
<p>Years passed, and the heroes became legends. Their stories were told in taverns and inns, in the courts of kings and the halls of the Mages. And despite the passage of time, the heroes remained a shining example of what it means to be a true hero, standing ready to defend the realm from any danger that may arise.</p>
<p>And so, the city of Luna, now a corrupted dungeon, remained a warning of what could happen if the people of Sosaria ever forgot the lessons of the past. But it was also a testament to the strength and bravery of the heroes who had saved the realm, and the Mages of Wind who had honored their bravery. For in a world of magic and wonder, there will always be those who are willing to fight for what is right, and the memory of their bravery will live on for generations to come.</p>
<p>And so the story of Duma and the heroes of Sosaria lives on, a tale of bravery and sacrifice, of greed and ambition, of the dangers of magic, and the power of courage. A tale of a world where heroes rise and where the Mages of Wind honor those who protect the realm, ensuring that the people of Sosaria will live in peace, protected by their heroes, for generations to come.</p>
