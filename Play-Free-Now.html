<h1>Feel like Installing in Manually?</h1>
<h2>Let's define a few things first:</h2>
<p><strong>Launcher</strong> : A program that helps a user locate and start other computer programs. During setup, you will make use of the official launchers briefly to patch your client's files, and then you will make use of a separate launch-assistant program to open and play the game in the future.<br><br><strong>Launch-assistant</strong> : Our term for a program that allows the user to connect to private/unofficial UO servers. These often include additional features such as macros, hotkeys, auto-looters, and more QoL features. When playing on the UOAlive server, you will open your chosen launch-assistant program when you want to play the game.&nbsp;<br><br><strong>Client</strong> : A program that is used to connect to a UO server. Simply put, this is how you access the game. If you were playing on the Official servers, you would simply open the Classic or Enhanced client and login from there, however to play on UOAlive, you will need an Assistant Program.&nbsp;</p>
<h1>What is Classic Client(recommended)?</h1>
<p>The Classic Client is the original look of Ultima Online, and is often considered the simpler client to learn/ preferred client to use. If you are already familiar with UO and would like to return to the game as you remember it, this may be the client for you!</p>
<ul>
  <li>The original "nostalgic" appearance of the game</li>
  <li>When paired with the Classic UO Launcher has a smooth excellent experience!</li>
  <li>Has more advanced macroing capabilities via launch-assistants</li>
  <li>Potential 240 FPS (when used with the ClassicUO Launch-assistant)</li>
  <li>Most popular version of the game and the most compatible with UOAlive</li>
  <li>The "way the game was meant to be played" as many will say.</li>
</ul>
<figure class="image image_resized" style="width:82.56%;"><img src="https://uoalive.com/images/unknowkkn.png" alt="A screenshot of what the Classic Client looks like in-game."></figure>
<h1>What is Enhanced Client?</h1>
<p>The Enhanced Client is a more recent version of the UO client that more closely resembles other modern MMOs. This client is notable for its enhanced graphics, more robust radar, visible macro bar, and more customizable interfaces. If you want to play UO in a way that is more familiar to modern MMO fans, this may be the choice for you! However most people do find themselve drawn to the Classic Client with the Classic UO Launcher as they learn the game better. Good news is you can have both installed at once!</p>
<ul>
  <li>More similar to modern MMOs</li>
  <li>Enhanced graphics and radar</li>
  <li>Macro bar and customizable interfaces</li>
  <li>Better new player experience if you have never played UO</li>
  <li>Not kept up to date as well as Classic by OSI and can have bugs.</li>
</ul>
<figure class="image image_resized" style="width:87.83%;"><img src="https://forum.uo.com/uploads/editor/l9/rl2a4mipmf58.jpg" alt="A screenshot of what the Enhanced Client looks like in-game."></figure>
<p>This Client requires the use of a specialized launch-assistant program due to the differences between it and the Classic Client.</p>
<h1>Choosing Your Install Setup</h1>
<h2>Install Classic UO w/ Razor Enhanced (recommended)</h2>
<p>ClassicUO (not to be confused with the Classic Client) is a launch-assistant program that utilizes the files from the Classic Client to provide a familiar visual experience, but with support for modern devices in the form of zooming, FPS controls, and custom gumps among others. (NOTE: If you are using ClassicUO, you will also need either Razor or Razor Enhanced to function properly, and to provide macro capabilities).</p>
<ul>
  <li>Support for higher screen resolutions</li>
  <li>Grid Loot</li>
  <li>Built-in map with party tracking capabilities</li>
  <li>FPS control and higher FPS support up to 240hz )</li>
  <li>Zooming capabilities</li>
  <li>Custom gumps (e.g. track item amounts, snap ability icons, etc.)</li>
  <li>A smooth gaming experience</li>
</ul>
<p>Razor Enhanced is an updated version of Razor using .Net 4.5. It is faster, less likely to crash, and includes new specialized agents such as auto-loot, scavenger, and better targeting. It also makes use of a Python-based macro system, which should be much easier for the average user to use. This launch-assistant also includes a UOSteam-mimic script engine, which should increase compatibility between the two programs' macro scripts. (NOTE: This program is still in Beta, and as such should be expected to have imperfections that may impair the player's experience).</p>
<ul>
  <li>Faster and more stable than plain Razor</li>
  <li>New specialized agents to help automate repetitive tasks (e.g. auto-loot)</li>
  <li>Python-based macro system</li>
  <li>UOSteam-mimic script engine (increased compatibility with UOSteam macros)</li>
</ul>
<p>Follow the steps or video below in order to set up your device to play on UOAlive:</p>

</figure>
<h3>Step 1: The Client</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Firstly, the Classic Client will need to be downloaded from the official site <a href="https://uo.com/getting-started/"><u>here</u></a> by clicking the image that looks like this:</li>
</ul>
<figure class="image"><img src="https://uoalive.com/images/UO_Clients_Classic_Download.PNG" alt="An image of the download link for the Classic Client."></figure>
<ul>
  <li>Once the Client is downloaded, open the downloaded executable to start the installation process</li>
  <li>Follow the steps as presented in the installation wizard, and you may want to make note of where the client is being saved to for later steps</li>
</ul>
<figure class="image"><img src="https://uoalive.com/images/UO_Clients_Classic_Install.PNG" alt="An image of the Classic Client's installation wizard."></figure>
<ul>
  <li>Once the installation is finished, you will want to launch the client either using the shortcut created during installation, or you can look in the folder it was saved to for the client.exe file, as well</li>
  <li>When the client is launched, the patcher will begin. Let the client patch fully but DO NOT click play once it is complete</li>
</ul>
<figure class="image"><img src="https://uoalive.com/images/UO_Clients_Classic_Patch.PNG" alt="An image of the Classic Client's patcher upon completion."></figure>
<h3>Step 2: The Launch-assistant(s)</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Now that the Client is ready, you will need to download the ClassicUO launch-assistant program <a href="https://www.classicuo.eu/"><u>here</u></a> using the link that corresponds to your operating system (likely Windowsx64):</li>
</ul>
<figure class="image image_resized" style="width:77.6%;"><img src="https://uoalive.com/images/UO_Launchssistants_ClassicUO_Download.PNG" alt="An image of the download link for ClassicUO."></figure>
<ul>
  <li>Once the download has finished, the files will need to be extracted using a file archiving tool such as <a href="https://www.rarlab.com/"><u>WinRAR</u></a> or <a href="https://www.7-zip.org/"><u>7-Zip</u></a> instead of using an installation wizard</li>
  <li>You may want to make note of where ClassicUO is being saved to for later steps</li>
  <li>Next, make sure that you have the latest version of VC++ by going to <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-US/cpp/windows/latest-supported-vc-redist"><u>this</u></a> page and downloading the version that corresponds to your architecture (likely x64)</li>
</ul>
<figure class="image image_resized" style="width:60.19%;"><img src="https://uoalive.com/images/UO_Launchssistants_ClassicUO_VC++_Download.PNG" alt="An image of the download link for VC++ needed for ClassicUO."></figure>
<ul>
  <li>You will then need to run the downloaded executable to install the VC++ update properly</li>
</ul>
<figure class="image image_resized" style="width:53.52%;"><img src="https://uoalive.com/images/UO_Launchssistants_ClassicUO_VC++_Install.PNG" alt="An image of the VC++ installation wizard."></figure>
<ul>
  <li>Razor Enhanced is also needed for this setup, and as such needs to be downloaded from <a href="https://razorenhanced.net/"><u>here</u></a> using the link shown below:</li>
</ul>
<figure class="image image_resized" style="width:57.95%;"><img src="https://uoalive.com/images/UO_Launchssistants_RazorEnhanced_Download.PNG" alt="An image of the download link for Razor Enhanced."></figure>
<ul>
  <li>Once the download has finished, the files will need to be extracted using a file archiving tool such as <a href="https://www.rarlab.com/"><u>WinRAR</u></a> or <a href="https://www.7-zip.org/"><u>7-Zip</u></a> instead of using an installation wizard</li>
  <li>You may want to make note of where Razor Enhanced is being saved to for later steps</li>
  <li>Once the launcher is extracted, you will want to launch ClassicUO either using the shortcut created during installation, or you can look in the folder it was saved to for the ClassicUOLauncher.exe file, as well</li>
</ul>
<h3>Step 3: Configuration</h3>
<ul>
  <li>At this point, all you need to do is point ClassicUO to your client, Razor, and the server itself</li>
  <li>Start by clicking the "Create First Profile" or "Open Profile Editor" button, click "Add", and enter your desired profile name</li>
  <li>You can select the UOAlive Preset to enter some of the information for you, including the server IP <i><strong>(login.uoalive.com)</strong></i> and port <i><strong>(2593)</strong></i></li>
  <li>Make sure that the "Use Encryption" option is unclicked, and the UO Path section should be set to the folder that holds your Classic Client installation's files (you may want to use your saved pathway here if you noted it earlier), at which point your profile should look similar to the image below, although your pathways may be slightly different</li>
</ul>
<figure class="image image_resized" style="width:65.79%;"><img src="https://uoalive.com/images/UO_Launchssistants_ClassicUO_Config_1.PNG" alt="An image of the ClassicUO launcher with the correct information in place to play on UOAlive."></figure>
<ul>
  <li>In order to add Razor Enhanced, you will first need to copy or cut the folder containing your Razor Enhanced installation and paste it into your ClassicUO/Data/Plugins folder</li>
  <li>Now, move to the Plugins tab, and click "Add" to point towards your Razor Enhanced installation (this may be another time to use a saved filepath from earlier), at which point your launcher should look similar to the image below:</li>
</ul>
<figure class="image image_resized" style="width:72.25%;"><img src="https://uoalive.com/images/UO_Launchssistants_ClassicUO_Config_2.PNG" alt="Another image of the ClassicUO launcher with the correct information in place to play on UOAlive."></figure>
<ul>
  <li>Finally, you can click the "Save Profile" button, then the "Play!" button to launch the game window</li>
</ul>
<h3>Step 4: Account Creation</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Once the UO login window appears, you may enter any unused username and password (under 12 characters) combination and click the "Login" button. This will create your account, and you will use this username and password whenever you play on UOAlive, so you may want to make note of it somewhere secure.</li>
</ul>
<figure class="image"><img src="https://uoalive.com/images/UO_Launchssistants_ClassicUO_Play.PNG" alt="An image of the ClassicUO login screen."></figure>
<ul>
  <li>NOTE: Your forum account and game account are separate, and although you may use the same name, changing your forum password will not change the password you use to play the game. In order to change you game account's password, you may open a ticket on the UOAlive Discord.</li>
</ul>
<figure class="image image_resized" style="width:83.1%;"><img src="https://uoalive.com/images/UO_ChangePasswordTicket.PNG" alt="An image of the ticket creation channel on the UO Alive Discord."></figure>
<h2>Install Web Client Mac/PC (beta)</h2>
<p>This is an alternative version of ClassicUO that runs in a web browser that is currently in Beta. This is effectively the same as a normal installation of ClassicUO, however it is hosted remotely which both reduces the amount of configuration necessary on the user's behalf, as well as the storage required. This tool is, however, still in development, and as such there is currently no assistant program for macros (although one is in development that will be similar to Razor), and the global map is currently unavailable.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Easy setup</li>
  <li>Files maintained and updated by host (i.e. no need for users to manage their own files)</li>
  <li>Simplified server discovery and connection</li>
  <li>No assistant program for macro support (<i><strong>yet</strong></i>)</li>
  <li>Global Map is currently bugged, which may hinder navigation</li>
</ul>
<p>Follow the steps below in order to set up your device to play on UOAlive:</p>
<h3>Step 1: The Web Browser</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Firstly, this client requires the user to be using the latest version of Google Chrome. Other browsers such as Firefox <i>may</i> be compatible, however the developers of this tool specifically mention Chrome as the browser to use for this client</li>
  <li>Users should ensure that they also have a few GB of unused memory, as once they connect for the first time, some files will be downloaded, although they will not require user intervention</li>
</ul>
<h3>Step 2: Connecting</h3>
<ul>
  <li>You may connect by clicking this direct link: <a href="https://play.classicuo.org/?shard=11"><u>PLAY UOALIVE ON THE WEB</u></a></li>
  <li>[SKIP TO STEP 3 IF THE ABOVE LINK WORKED]If that doesn't work you can click <a href="https://play.classicuo.org/"><u>here</u></a>. Once you are logged in, select UOAlive from the server list, and will be connected with the server</li>
</ul>

<h3>Step 3: Account Creation</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Once the UO login window appears, you may enter any unused username and password (under 12 characters) combination and click the "Login" button. This will create your account, and you will use this username and password whenever you play on UOAlive, so you may want to make note of it somewhere secure.</li>

<h2>Install Razor Enhanced Standalone</h2>
<p>Razor Enhanced is an updated version of Razor using .Net 4.5. It is faster, less likely to crash, and includes new specialized agents such as auto-loot, scavenger, and better targeting. It also makes use of a Python-based macro system, which should be much easier for the average user to use. This launch-assistant also includes a UOSteam-mimic script engine, which should increase compatibility between the two programs' macro scripts. (NOTE: This program is still in Beta, and as such should be expected to have imperfections that may impair the player's experience).</p>
<ul>
  <li>Faster and more stable than plain Razor</li>

  <li>Once the installation is finished, you will want to launch the client either using the shortcut created during installation, or you can look in the folder it was saved to for the client.exe file, as well</li>
  <li>When the client is launched, the patcher will begin. Let the client patch fully but DO NOT click play once it is complete</li>
</ul>

<h3>Step 2: The Launch-assistant</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Now that the Client is ready, you will need to download the UOSteam launch-assistant program <a href="https://www.uosteam.com/"><u>here</u></a> using either the Dropbox or GitHub link shown below:</li>
</ul>
<figure class="image"><img src="https://uoalive.com/images/UO_Launchssistants_UOSteam_Download.PNG" alt="An image of the download link for UOSteam."></figure>
<ul>
  <li>Once the download has finished, open the downloaded executable to start the installation process</li>
  <li>Follow the steps as presented in the installation wizard, and you may want to make note of where UOSteam is being saved to for later steps</li>
</ul>
<figure class="image"><img src="https://uoalive.com/images/UO_Launchssistants_UOSteam_Install.PNG" alt="An image of UOSteam's installation wizard."></figure>
<ul>
  <li>Once the installation is finished, you will want to launch UOSteam either using the shortcut created during installation, or you can look in the folder it was saved to for the UOS.exe file, as well</li>
</ul>
<h3>Step 3: Configuration</h3>
<ul>
  <li>At this point, all you need to do is point UOSteam to your client and the server itself</li>
  <li>Start by editing the Client Options section, and change it to the client.exe file from your classic client installation (you may want to use your saved pathway here if you noted it earlier)</li>
  <li>You will use the same pathway for the Ultima Online section, however you will only point to the folder that holds your client.exe and other files instead of the file itself</li>
  <li>At this point, you will need to enter the shard address <i><strong>(login.uoalive.com)</strong></i> and port <i><strong>(2593)</strong></i>, and you will need to make sure that remove encryption is checked</li>
  <li>Once all of this is done, your launcher should look similar to the image below, although your pathways may be slightly different</li>
</ul>
<figure class="image"><img src="https://uoalive.com/images/UO_Launchssistants_UOSteam_Config.PNG" alt="An image of the UOSteam launcher with the correct information in place to play on UOAlive."></figure>
<ul>
  <li>Finally, you can click the "Start" button, make sure the "Negotiate features with server" option is checked, and launch the game window</li>
</ul>
<h3>Step 4: Account Creation</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Once the UO login window appears, you may enter any unused username and password (under 12 characters) combination and click the "Login" button. This will create your account, and you will use this username and password whenever you play on UO Alive, so you may want to make note of it somewhere secure.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>NOTE: Your forum account and game account are separate, and although you may use the same name, changing your forum password will not change the password you use to play the game. In order to change you game account's password, you may open a ticket on the UOAlive Discord.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Install Orion (Tech Savvy Only!)</h2>
<p>OrionUO is a launch-assistant program that is similar to ClassicUO in many ways, but it does not work with Razor, Razor Enhanced, or UOSteam. One potential advantage of this option is its JavaScript macro system, which may be more familiar (or else easier to find references for) than some of the other tools' more unique scripting languages.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Higher FPS support</li>
  <li>Flexible display settings</li>
  <li>Scripting using JavaScript</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Installation Instructions</strong></p>
<p>Follow the steps below in order to set up your device to play on UO Alive:</p>
<h3>Step 1: The Client</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Firstly, the Classic Client will need to be downloaded from the official site <a href="https://uo.com/getting-started/"><u>here</u></a> by clicking the image that looks like this:</li>
</ul>
<figure class="image"><img src="https://uoalive.com/images/UO_Clients_Classic_Download.PNG" alt="An image of the download link for the Classic Client."></figure>
<ul>
  <li>Once the Client is downloaded, open the downloaded executable to start the installation process</li>
  <li>Follow the steps as presented in the installation wizard, and you may want to make note of where the client is being saved to for later steps</li>
</ul>
<figure class="image"><img src="https://uoalive.com/images/UO_Clients_Classic_Install.PNG" alt="An image of the Classic Client's installation wizard."></figure>
<ul>
  <li>Once the installation is finished, you will want to launch the client either using the shortcut created during installation, or you can look in the folder it was saved to for the client.exe file, as well</li>
  <li>When the client is launched, the patcher will begin. Let the client patch fully but DO NOT click play once it is complete</li>
</ul>
<figure class="image"><img src="https://uoalive.com/images/UO_Clients_Classic_Patch.PNG" alt="An image of the Classic Client's patcher upon completion."></figure>
<h3>Step 2: The Launch-assistant</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Now that the Client is ready, you will need to download the OrionUO launch-assistant program <a href="http://orionuo.online/"><u>here</u></a> using the link that corresponds to your operating system (likely Windowsx64):</li>
</ul>
<figure class="image image_resized" style="width:71.76%;"><img src="https://uoalive.com/images/UO_Launchssistants_OrionUO_Download.PNG" alt="An image of the download link for OrionUO."></figure>
<ul>
  <li>Once the download has finished, open the downloaded executable to start the installation process</li>
  <li>Follow the steps as presented in the installation wizard, and you may want to make note of where OrionUO is being saved to for later steps</li>
</ul>
<figure class="image"><img src="https://uoalive.com/images/UO_Launchssistants_OrionUO_Install.PNG" alt="An image of OrionUO's installation wizard."></figure>
<ul>
  <li>Once the installation is finished, you will want to launch OrionUO either using the shortcut created during installation, or you can look in the folder it was saved to for the OrionLauncher[YourVersionHere].exe file (Likely OrionLauncher64.exe), as well</li>
</ul>
<h3>Step 3: Configuration</h3>
<ul>
  <li>At this point, all you need to do is point OrionUO to your client and the server itself</li>
  <li>Start by pointing towards the client.exe file from your classic client installation (you may want to use your saved pathway here if you noted it earlier) in order to determine the client version using the "FROM CLIENT.EXE FILE" option during setup</li>
  <li>You will then click "Create" to save this version in your launcher before closing the client version configuration windows</li>
  <li>In the UO Files Path section, target the folder that contains your classic client installation</li>
  <li>Next, you will edit the Orion Path section so that it targets the folder that you installed OrionUO to</li>
  <li>You will need to move to the Updates tab if not already there, and you will want to Check Updates and Apply Updates before continuing</li>
  <li>Next, you will return to the Profile tab, and you can rename the server to UOAlive. Then, click the "Default Profile" and click "Edit Profile"</li>
  <li>At this point, you will need to enter a profile name (which can be your character, account, or server name depending on your preferences), as well as the shard address <i><strong>(login.uoalive.com)</strong></i> and port <i><strong>(2593)</strong></i> (Which for this launch-assistant need to be formatted as <i><strong>"login.uoalive.com,2593"</strong></i>)</li>
  <li>Once all of this is done, your launcher should look similar to the image below, although your pathways may be slightly different</li>
</ul>
<figure class="image"><img src="https://uoalive.com/images/UO_Launchssistants_OrionUO_Config.PNG" alt="An image of the OrionUO launcher with the correct information in place to play on UOAlive."></figure>
<ul>
  <li>Finally, you can click the "Launch" button and launch the game window</li>
</ul>
<h3>Step 4: Account Creation</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Once the UO login window appears, you may enter any unused username and password (under 12 characters) combination and click the "Login" button. This will create your account, and you will use this username and password whenever you play on UO Alive, so you may want to make note of it somewhere secure.</li>
</ul>
<figure class="image"><img src="https://uoalive.com/images/UO_Launchssistants_OrionUO_Play.PNG" alt="An image of the login screen with the OrionUO assistant window."></figure>
<ul>
  <li>NOTE: Your forum account and game account are separate, and although you may use the same name, changing your forum password will not change the password you use to play the game. In order to change you game account's password, you may open a ticket on the UOAlive Discord.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Install MobileUO (Must self Host)</h2>
<p>It is worth noting that there is also a mobile app that can be used to connect to UO Alive, however few users have experience with this application, which may make it more difficult to overcome any challenges encountered. It also makes use of the ClassicUO Launch-assistant, however it utilizes Unity to port it to mobile. The video shown below explains how to configure this application, however information regarding this application is somewhat challenging to find, so it may require a bit of trial and error as updates come:</p>
