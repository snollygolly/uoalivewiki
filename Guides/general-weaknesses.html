<p>Undead- Fire, unless fighting a hellsteed which is unlikely&nbsp;<br><br>Reptile- Cold or poison, some are weak to one but strong against the other&nbsp;<br><br>Demon- Cold or energy with a few exceptions&nbsp;<br><br>Repond- Fire or physical with a few exceptions&nbsp;<br><br>Elemental- No prefered element, AI or consecrate weapon should be used&nbsp;<br><br>Fey- Fire with a few exceptions&nbsp;<br><br>Arachnid- Fire&nbsp;<br><br>Each slayer group has their exceptions. For example a white wyrm is not weak to cold like most reptiles. It's weakest is fire which is different from most other reptiles. If you are unsure of what is the weakest for a specific enemy, it is best to look into it on UOGuide for the specific resistances. This should help with general use for those who would like a quick reference.</p>
