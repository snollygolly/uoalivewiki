<h1>What is gardening?&nbsp;</h1>
<p><a href="https://www.uoguide.com/Gardening">https://www.uoguide.com/Gardening</a>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Gardening is a non-Skill based activity that any character can try. It allows you to grow many different types of decorative Plants, some of which even produce valuable resources." <i><strong>Stolen from uoguide.com</strong></i>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can start with a bowl, some dirt, water, and a seed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Bowl - Provisioner&nbsp;</p>
<p>Fertile Dirt - Earth Elementals - or - purchased from NPC Mystics in Ter Mur</p>
<p>Water - Provisioner&nbsp;</p>
<p>Seed - Boglings&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>BUT, I would highly recommend having a Raised Garden Bed. Why? Because without it, you need water, and potions, and OMG WHY?!?!&nbsp;</p>
<p>Raised Garden Beds are available from the UOStore for 375 sovereigns for a set of 3.</p>

<h1>The Basics</h1>
<p>The very basic of gardening is you plant a seed, you get more seeds (most of the time), maybe a resource, and a plant. But there is so much more to it. Seeds! Resources! DYES?!? Cross-pollination! Peculiar Plants! SO many colors! Quests!&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, lets get some <a href="https://www.uoguide.com/Plants_%26_Seeds">seeds</a>!</p>
<p>The initial starting seeds are dropped by:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.uoguide.com/Bogling">Boglings</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.uoguide.com/Bog_Thing">Bog Things</a></li>
</ul>
<p>They will come in one of 4 varieties: Plain, Red, Blue or Yellow</p>
<p>At this point, it is unknown what type of seed you have. You can plant it and wing it, or use <a href="https://www.uoguide.com/Poppies_Dust">Poppies Dust </a>or a <a href="https://www.uoguide.com/Seed_Box">Seed Box.</a></p>
<p>You can get the seed box from the Magical Stone Exchange for 250 Soverigns.</p>

<p>Once planted, it takes 9 days for the plant to be ready to harvest.</p>
<p>If the plant produces seeds or resources, you will start getting 1 a day for the next 8 days. 17 days from the day you plant the seed until the last seed/resource is given.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Beyond The Basics</h2>
<p>Ok, you got a seed, you planted it, you got more of the same seeds, now what?</p>
<p><a href="https://uo.com/wiki/ultima-online-wiki/gameplay/crafting/plant-growing/cross-pollination/"><strong>CROSS-POLLINATION</strong></a></p>
<p>On day 7 of the plant life cycle, you can choose to cross-polinate your plants.</p>
<p>Doing so is how you will get different types of plants. The following is from uoguide.com</p>
<figure class="image"><img src="/plant_breeding_table.png"></figure>
<p>The seeds you start with are going to be one of 3 types:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Ferns</li>
  <li>Campion Flowers</li>
  <li>Tribarrel Cacti</li>
</ul>
<p>From there, you can cross them to get one of the other types of plants.</p>
