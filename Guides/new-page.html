<h1>What is gardening?&nbsp;</h1>

<p>"Gardening is a non-Skill based activity that any character can try. It allows you to grow many different types of decorative Plants, some of which even produce valuable resources." <i><strong>Stolen from uoguide.com</strong></i>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can start with a bowl, some dirt, water, and a seed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Bowl - Provisioner&nbsp;</p>
<p>Fertile Dirt - Earth Elementals - or - purchased from NPC Mystics in Ter Mur</p>
<p>Water - Provisioner&nbsp;</p>
<p>Seed - Boglings&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>BUT, I would highly recommend having a Raised Garden Bed. Why? Because without it, you need water, and potions, and OMG WHY?!?!&nbsp;</p>

<h2>The Basics</h2>
<p>The very basic of gardening is you plant a seed, you get more seeds (most of the time), maybe a resource, and a plant. But there is so much more to it. Seeds! Resources! DYES?!? Cross-pollination! Peculiar Plants! SO many colors! Quests!&nbsp;</p>
