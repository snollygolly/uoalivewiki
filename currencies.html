<p>PLACEHOLDER ARTICLE TO BE EDITED<br><br>There are 4 currencies on UOAlive: Gold, Sovereigns, Event Tokens, and BRITCOINs.<br><br><strong>Gold</strong> is acquired through a variety of means. From slaying fearsome beasts and embarking on epic quests, to searching for hidden treasures via treasure hunting, high seas plundering or epic champion battles. Or perhaps you want to interact with others? Selling valuable items to fellow players is quite fruitful, there's no shortage of ways to increase your gold balance.<br><br>And keeping track of your hard-earned wealth is a breeze. Simply type "[wallet" in the game and voila! You'll be able to view your gold balance and Sovereign count from anywhere, any time.<br><br>Banked gold is bound to your account and not limited by your character's carrying capacity unlike in the bag. That means that when you deposit gold into your bank, it deposits into your account balance, like magic. Withdrawing funds is just as simple - simply say "withdraw (amount)" to a banker, or if you're looking to make a trade, simply type the amount you wish to spend in the lower left corner of the trade window.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Sovereigns</strong> are used for purchasing items from the UO Store and are earned from completing certain tasks or achievements(access by typing [myachievements in game), as well as from participating in events. These can also be purchased from the Magical Stone Exchange or from other players who sell them at a discounted price. Once added to a player's wallet (by double clicking them), Sovereigns are account bound and cannot be withdrawn.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>BRITCOIN(BTC)â„¢</strong>, is earned by simply being logged into the game, you are rewarded for your time in game so you have even more currency to spend on fun and exciting items since UOAlive has no pay to win items. Players can earn double (or similar) BRITCOIN while in blessed areas such as The Three Stone Tavern, Zento Vendor Plaza, Rune Library, Britain crafting area, West Britain Bank, and others so encourage you to hang out at these locations prior to engagements or for events. BRITCOIN can be traded or sold between accounts and players. Additionally, BRITCOIN can be exchanged for Sovereigns at the Magical Stone Exchange in New Magincia (Moongate Network under special locations).<br><br><strong>Event Tokens</strong> are earned by participating in events at varying rates, such as the monthly Luna Invasion. Players can type [invasion in game to see when invasions will happen. The Event Token stone at the Magical Stone Exchange has items that can only be purchased with Event Tokens. These may be traded or sold between accounts and players.</p>

<p>Kudos were the precursor to BRITCOIN. From about November 2022 until January 2023, Kudos were phased out via a stone exchange in New Magincia. The phase out exchange was ended on the 1st of February 2023. This change came about due to a suggestion by a UOAlive community member. https://discord.com/channels/221645501806804993/498264820915896341/1069579814111019109</p>
