<p>If you have been following along with our Dreams event here: <a href="https://uoalive.com/forum/threads/could-it-actually-be-a-dream.643/"><u>https://uoalive.com/forum/threads/could-it-actually-be-a-dream.643/</u></a><br><br>You will know that Luna is no longer a safe city. It was besieged by great evil. It all centered around the once renowned Rune Library created by one of our amazing players Lylah Sol.<br><br>Well... here is the before and after...<br>&nbsp;</p>

<h1>What we are offering you is a chance to not only win some great prizes but to be a part of the History of this great downfall of Luna!</h1>
<p>To truly create the epic feel of a flourishing vendor city destroyed from the inside out, by the explosion that came from The Rune Library, we want to fill the city with destroyed homes such as the Former rune Library, which BOTH were designed by Lylah Sol for the event!</p>
<p>With some creativity, we are hoping you can create the remaining destroyed homes, that got destroyed inside the walls of Luna to the explosion, be it a sprawling Vendor Mall or a small humble abode, crumbled from the shockwave.</p>

<p>We will be taking submissions through screenshots of your house design on this forum topic.</p>
<p>Those who get accepted will have their homes moved to Luna (not taking up a house slot on their account) and made into a permanent feature of the new "Fallen Luna Dungeon".</p>
<p>As well you will be rewarded with Sovereigns!</p>
<p>So let us see your most creatively destroyed homes! Decorate them as much or as little as you want and with whatever you want&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Just make sure it feels as if it was destroyed from the massive Rune Library explosion!</strong></p>
