<h2><strong>Privacy Policy for UOAlive Ultima Online Server</strong></h2>
<p>At UOAlive, we are committed to protecting the privacy of our users. This Privacy Policy outlines the types of personal information we may collect, how we use it, and the steps we take to safeguard your information.</p>
<h2><strong>Information Collection</strong></h2>
<p>We may collect personal information from you when you register to use our UOAlive server, participate in forums or other interactive features of the server, make purchases, or use our support services. This information may include your name, email address, IP address, and other information necessary to provide our services.</p>
<p>We may also collect non-personal information such as server usage data, gameplay statistics, and technical information about your device and software.</p>
<h2><strong>Information Use</strong></h2>
<p>We use the information we collect to provide and improve our services, to communicate with you, and to personalize your experience on our server. We may use your personal information to send you promotional materials, but you may opt out of these communications at any time.</p>
<p>We may also share your personal information with third-party service providers who help us deliver our services or who perform functions on our behalf. We require these providers to use your information only for the purpose of providing the service to us and to protect your information in a manner consistent with this Privacy Policy.</p>
<h2><strong>Information Security</strong></h2>
<p>We take reasonable measures to protect your information from unauthorized access, disclosure, or destruction. We use industry-standard encryption technologies and implement administrative, physical, and technical safeguards to protect your information.</p>
<p>However, please note that no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, and we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us.</p>
<h2><strong>Changes to this Privacy Policy</strong></h2>
<p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time, and we will notify you of any changes by posting the updated policy on our server. Your continued use of our server after we make changes indicates your acceptance of those changes.</p>
<h2><strong>Team Policies</strong></h2>
<p>At UOAlive, we take the protection of our users' information very seriously. To ensure that our team is held accountable for maintaining confidentiality, we require all team members to sign a non-disclosure agreement (NDA) before accessing any sensitive information.</p>
<p>This NDA prohibits team members from disclosing any confidential information to third parties without prior written consent from the company. Additionally, team members are not allowed to use the confidential information for any purposes other than performing their duties for UOAlive.</p>
<p>Any breach of the NDA will result in disciplinary action, which may include termination of the team member's engagement with UOAlive and potential legal action.</p>
<p>We believe that holding our team accountable in this way is an important step in protecting our users' information and ensuring their trust in us.</p>
