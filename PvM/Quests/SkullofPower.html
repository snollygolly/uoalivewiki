<h1><strong>The Skull of Power</strong></h1>
<p>By TomJ - he hates the spotlight, but you should all tell him it is awesome anyway.<br><i>This Quest is inspired from Ultima Lore and a "simplified" D&amp;D mindset.</i></p>

<p>In the land of Sosaria, a noble merchant named Elboron has been stricken with worry. His daughter, a fair maiden of great beauty and wit, has chosen to forsake her family's ways and venture out to become a sorceress of great power. Elboron knew not where she had gone nor what dangers she might face, for the world was a treacherous one, full of dark powers and malevolent creatures.</p>
<p>Desperate to find his daughter, Elboron heard tales of brave adventurers passing through the Three Stones Tavern. He seeks out mages, warriors, summoners, paladins, and even the less savory necromancers, all in the hopes of finding a group of courageous heroes who will aid him in his quest.</p>
<p>And so, the call has gone out across the land, calling upon those who will take up the noble quest. The rewards will be great, for Elboron is a wealthy merchant and can offer a sum that would make any adventurer's heart skip a beat.</p>
<p>But this quest will not be easy. The heroes who answer the call will have to brave the dangers of the wilds, battle fierce beasts, dark magic, solve exceptionally complex riddles and outwit cunning foes who seek to use Elboron's daughter for their own nefarious purposes.</p>
<p>And yet, for those who dare to take up the quest, there is great honor and glory to be had. For they will be remembered in the annals of Sosaria as the ones who saved the noble merchant's daughter, and perhaps even more… as something else foul may be afoot… something in the shadows… but [perhaps that is simply] a rumor?"?</p>
<p>So, will you heed the call of Elboron and take up the quest to find his daughter? Will you be the heroes who brave the dangers of the wilds and overcome the challenges that lie ahead? The fate of Sosaria rests in your hands, brave adventurer.</p>

<h1><strong>THE IMPORTANT STUFF SO READ:</strong></h1>
<h2><strong>1. Grouping - Party</strong></h2>
<ul>
  <li>It is highly recommended to complete the quest in a group. However, ensure that all party members are in party mode to avoid missing out on crucial items, storytelling, and other important elements. Additionally, remember to recreate the party after death to maintain party progression.</li>
  <li>Check your Quest log book, first page, when joining g a party to make sure you are all at the same level<br>&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<figure class="image"><img src="https://uoalive.com/forum/attachments/image-png.1953/" alt="image.png"></figure>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
  <li>To progress through the quest as a group, all party members must be at the same stage of advancement. Otherwise, it may not work as intended.</li>
  <li>It is possible to have a player who is not participating in the quest assist with killing mobs. However, they will not receive any quest items, and some encounters may adjust difficulty accordingly.</li>
  <li>When entering an area or stage of the quest, players may receive a message indicating that one or more players are already present. Please be patient and wait until the area is available before proceeding. <strong>You will not be able to enter if not in the current player(s) party.</strong></li>
</ul>
<figure class="image"><img src="https://uoalive.com/forum/attachments/1677784014906-png.1896/" alt="1677784014906.png"></figure>
<figure class="image"><img src="https://uoalive.com/forum/attachments/1677784022484-png.1897/" alt="1677784022484.png"></figure>
<p>Remember like all games, make sure the party you join is communicating, people you want to be in a party with, and takes their time to keep the party alive and progressing together. If you join random parties you can end up missing crucial steps and we cannot be responsible for you no longer know what to do.​</p>
<p>You get the same loot from being in a party as you do out of a party.​</p>
<h2><strong>2. Game mechanics</strong></h2>
<ul>
  <li>This quest does not use the standard quest system found in Ultima Online. Instead, upon accepting the quest, you will receive a Quest Log Book. This book is blessed and contains important information, so <strong>be sure to keep it safe and not lose it(they will not be replaced and you will need to open a help ticket to be reset and will use your one "freebie" card for your account on UOAlive).</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>This means the Quest <u>cannot be reset unless done by a Game Master to prevent exploitation</u>. You can only re-do it once completed(in a limited form).</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>As this quest does not provide precise directions or tasks, pay close attention to clues, read the notes, and search for important items in boss loot. These items are labeled as "Quest items" and will be necessary to progress through the quest. Take your time.</li>
  <li>Some Quest items require you to Double Click them to loot them, these will show under the description of the item, this is how you decipher them from regular loot. The item will then be distributed to all party members' backpacks or banks (if your backpack is full). Other important quest items will go directly to your pack.<br><strong>If using ClassicUO Launcher it is HIGHLY recommended to turn off "Double Click to Loot" for Quest Items:</strong><br>&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>Throughout the quest, there will be various items to aid you. The most crucial ones are labeled as "Quest items" and are blessed. <strong>Please do not lose them or you will be unable to complete the quest.</strong></li>
  <li>The quest can be repeated, but rewards will decrease from the second run onward. This quest is meant to be done once per account for the Token turn in, otherwise it is just a fun adventure to be had! This is 100% intentional and within TomJ's quest design of the Journey not the Rewards.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>WARNING: ANY MODIFIED CLIENT AND/OR ANYTHING THAT ISN'T PART OF THE LATEST CLASSICUO LAUNCHER, UOALIVE LAUNCHER, ENHANCED CLIENT, UOSTEAM, OR RAZOR, MAY NOT WORK AS INTENDED. USE AT YOUR OWN RISK. ITEMS WILL NOT BE REPLACED IN THESE SITUATIONS IF LOST AND YOUR QUEST WILL BE RESET.</strong></p>
<h2><strong>3. Difficulty</strong></h2>
<ul>
  <li>If you are capable of defeating the Peerless enemies on your own, the upcoming fights should be a breeze.</li>
  <li>If you are finding the Abyss to be a struggle, it may be best to team up with other players to enhance your chances of success and increase your enjoyment of the game.</li>
  <li>For those at a lower level, attempting to take on these challenges solo can be extremely difficult and time-consuming. It is highly recommended to seek out support or risk frequent deaths and prolonged battles.</li>
  <li>New players are not recommended to tackle these encounters solo. It is advisable to join a party or request assistance from more experienced players.</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>COMMON COURTESY TO FELLOW PLAYERS:</strong></h2>
<ul>
  <li>This quest is not instanced to maintain the open world experience of the MMO. As a result, it is possible for multiple groups to reach the same tasks at the same time, but it is not possible to complete them simultaneously with different parties. Communication is therefore essential. Party with strangers, promise you won't melt.</li>
  <li>If multiple groups are doing the quest at the same time, please communicate with each other and take turns doing each step if you arrive at them together. This will help prevent any disruption or confusion during the quest.</li>
  <li>Griefing or interrupting another group's enjoyment of the quest is not allowed and will result in action taken according to UOAlive's “common sense” rules. Please be considerate and follow “common sense” courtesy rules during the quest.</li>
  <li>Above all, please be kind to each other and communicate effectively to ensure a positive experience for all parties involved.</li>
  <li><strong>PLEASE DO NOT POST SPOILERS ON DISCORD OR THE WEBSITE.</strong></li>
  <li><strong>PLEASE DO NOT CREATE AND SELL RUNEBOOKS TO THE LOCATIONS IN THE QUEST FOR AT LEAST A MONTH PLEASE.</strong></li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Hints:</strong></h2>
<ul>
  <li>ALWAYS check your Quest Book Log for clues! It knows all! Afterall it is your inner thoughts!</li>
  <li>When North South East Or West are referenced it means the classic Compass Map, not the ClassicUOLauncher one. You can open both in ClassicUOLauncher:<br>&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<h3>Spoiler Hints:</h3>
<p>Some things require you to type in game. Think DnD campaign or BEFORE Discord. Use that "Say".</p>
<h3>Spoiler Hint:</h3>
<p>Grab moonstones from Magincia Magical Stone area on the ground to go between Trammel and Felucca with ease!</p>
