<h1><strong>Invasions are a popular event in UOAlive</strong></h1>
<p>offering players rewards and a chance to participate in lore-rich experiences. There are several types of invasions, including weekly invasions, monthly invasions, and yearly or one-off invasions.<br><br>&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>Weekly invasions</strong></h2>
<p>reward players with specific resources, such as bods or a guaranteed Barracoon spawn(since champion spawns are randomized here), and can be found in Moonglow/Britain's Vermin infestation(Bods), and the Cove Pirate invasion(Baracoon).</p>

<h2><strong>Monthly invasions&nbsp;</strong></h2>
<p>offer a deeper story and lore experience, such as the Invasion of Luna Dungeon, <a href="https://uoalive.com/forum/threads/dreams-the-fall-of-luna.643/"><u>(lore can be read here) </u></a>and powerful items can drop from all mini bosses and bosses alike. These events are meant to be accessible to all levels of players, but groups are highly recommended to complete them as they do get harder in difficulty as they progress.</p>

<h2><strong>Yearly or one-off invasions</strong></h2>
<p>such as the Undead Invasion of Trinsic and the Titan invasions in Vesper, run less frequently but offer similar prizes. Event-related invasions will not offer Event Tokens but Sovereigns, which can be used to make other stones more accessible to players.</p>
