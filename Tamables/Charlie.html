<p><strong>This encounter is meant for a group of veteran players, and while new players can absolutely contribute, it is unlikely that you will be able to solo this content. Charlie himself has some of the strangest attack sounds in the game currently and has a very “on brand” experience to capture him. Good luck in the Candy Mountain cave!</strong></p>
