<h1>&lt;span class="custom-color-pink"&gt;<strong>DIVERSITY:&lt;/span&gt;</strong></h1>
<p><br><strong>There are 4 different types of new tame-ables in the world</strong><i>(can have multiple of the below per creature)</i><strong>:</strong><br>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>Exquisite </strong>- A different hue of a normal creature (collect them all)</h3>

<h3><strong>Exotic </strong>- A powerful beast that will be similar to other pets to break up the "meta" visually. Can come in multiple colors</h3>
<figure class="image image_resized" style="width:164px;"><img src="https://uoalive.com/forum/attachments/1674091559424-png.1495/" alt="1674091559424.png"></figure>
<h3><strong>Rare </strong>- A very different version of an existing/or brand new creature with different stats, tame-slots etc.</h3>
<figure class="image image_resized" style="width:208px;"><img src="https://uoalive.com/forum/attachments/1674091627772-png.1496/" alt="1674091627772.png"></figure>
<h3><strong>Legendary </strong>- A very very rare creature, with a one of a kind hue and stats.</h3>
<figure class="image image_resized" style="width:225px;"><img src="https://uoalive.com/forum/attachments/1674091457282-png.1493/" alt="1674091457282.png"></figure>
<p><strong>They can have multiple tags!</strong></p>

<p>-----------------------</p>
<h1><strong>ADVENTURE:</strong></h1>
<p><strong>In order to tame these harder hitting creatures you will need to adventure for them!</strong></p>
<p>Instead of crazy timers we have made it so the mobs will share a spawner with other mobs. This means there is an RNG aspect to the actual mob spawning and you will need to fight your way through monsters to get it to spawn.</p>
<p><strong>There are ways to know you are in the right place:</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;the spawn will seem a little bit off for the area normally, and there will be sound ques as well as flavor text. So keep an eye out!</p>
<figure class="image"><img src="https://uoalive.com/forum/attachments/1675805630787-png.1668/" alt="1675805630787.png"></figure>
<p><strong>Some of these spawns have waves of beasts that must be defeated before you get to your tame-able creature!</strong></p>
<p><strong>A list of pets available through this system:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>A Basilisk</strong></li>
  <li><strong>A Naja</strong></li>
  <li><strong>A Spider</strong></li>
  <li><strong>A Wilfdfire Ostard</strong></li>
  <li><strong>A Ride-able HellHound</strong></li>
  <li><strong>A Dread War Horse</strong></li>
  <li><strong>A special Exotic version of the Windrunner</strong></li>
  <li><strong>A special Exotic version of the Lasher named Charlie</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>You can experience a version of this system(sans the tame-able) as a New Player on Level 2 of the New Player Dungeon Wing 4!</strong></p>
<p><i>We believe this is a happy middle ground for getting your epic pets an adventure versus a walk in the park, but also a rewarding way to get them as well! This caters to both casual players and hardcore. Ultimately making your time online valuable and not wasted.</i></p>
<h1><strong>Examples of some of the Custom Pets:</strong></h1>
<p><i>We are continuing to balance tamable animals so the "Meta" is more diverse and fun. No one wants to have everyone with the same pets!</i></p>
<p><i>-------------------------</i></p>
<p>Dragons (DPS-focused) have a chance to spawn as "RARE" with special title and hue, being 3-slot instead of the normal 4-slot making them more viable for taming and rivaling CU's.</p>
<p>Greater Dragons (tankier) also have a chance to spawn as "RARE" with special title and hue, and 3-slot, making them more viable for taming and rivaling CU's.</p>
<p>Special Rare Nightmares will now be labeled as "Rare" and have a unique hue, making them easier to identify.</p>
<figure class="image image_resized" style="width:485px;"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/366wZNX.png" alt="366wZNX.png"></figure>
<p>White Wyrms, Shadow Wyrms, and Serpentine Dragons now have a "RARE" variant, with a special title and hue, and being 3-slot instead of the normal 4-slot, providing greater diversity in taming options.</p>
<figure class="image image_resized" style="width:477px;"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/Zb7Fnsg.png" alt="Zb7Fnsg.png"></figure>
<p>Dragons have a chance to spawn as a hued exotic type. They have no special skills just a cool collector color!</p>

<h1>Always more choice:​</h1>
<p>A simpler addition: Horse Barding Deeds mimic Swamp Dragon Barding so you can have cool looking horses instead of ugly swamp dragons. You create them the same way you do Dragon barding. You will need to find a new horse to apply it to though, the Wild Mustang!</p>
<figure class="image image_resized" style="width:210px;"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/M1t9pGa.png" alt="M1t9pGa.png"></figure>
<p>Or perhaps you don't want a Blue Beetle but a Mule to carry your items!</p>
<figure class="image image_resized" style="width:328px;"><img src="https://uoalive.com/forum/attachments/1674154756380-png.1509/" alt="1674154756380.png"></figure>
<h1>Pet Bonding:​</h1>
<p>At UOAlive, we understand the disappointment of losing a newly tamed pet. To prevent this, we offer Pet Bonding Deeds available at the Magincia Bazaar and Bonding Potions available in our store, allowing you to bond with your pet instantly without the usual 7-day waiting period. For those who prefer the traditional bonding process, you can always use the&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>[bondinfo</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;command to check the status of your pet's bonding progress.</p>
<figure class="image"><img src="https://uoalive.com/forum/attachments/1674093113303-png.1498/" alt="1674093113303.png"></figure>
<h1>Pet "At a Glance" info:​</h1>
<p>We've made numerous improvements to enhance your taming experience. With just a simple click, you can now view the contents of your pet's backpack(of it has one). The pet's loyalty percentage is also prominently displayed on its gump, making it easy to keep track.</p>
<figure class="image image_resized" style="width:317px;"><img src="https://uoalive.com/forum/attachments/1674093135351-png.1499/" alt="1674093135351.png"></figure>
<h1>Pet Leashes:​</h1>
<p>Conveniently leash and store your pets in your backpack, but keep in mind that this comes with a trade-off. Leashed pets, although shrunken, still weigh a considerable amount and and cannot be unleashed or re-leashed in many dungeons. This will limit the amount of gold you can collect from spawns, loot you can carry, and make choosing the right pet to un-Shrink prior to your adventure an important decision!</p>
<figure class="image image_resized" style="width:443px;"><img src="https://uoalive.com/forum/attachments/1674093407803-png.1500/" alt="1674093407803.png"></figure>
<h1>Pet Aftermarket:​</h1>
<p>Unlock new possibilities in pet trading on UOAlive by pre-bonding(feeding a pet once before listing it for sale) and selling them on the global market. Other players can purchase them and, once the bonding period of 7 days has passed, instantly bond the pet to themselves. Additionally, players can also view pets on the global market and player vendors, allowing for easy and informed purchasing decisions, even for those with zero taming skills.</p>
<figure class="image image_resized" style="width:618px;"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/8fN9ykC.png" alt="8fN9ykC.png"></figure>
<h1>Pet Care:​</h1>
<p>Reviving a fallen pet can be a daunting task, especially for new players. That's why we've made it easy for everyone. We've set up a Pet Resurrection Stone at the Zento stable to help you quickly bring your loyal companion back to life and get back into the action. And don't worry, if you have fallen with your pet, a Corpse Summoner is conveniently located nearby, making it easy for you to revive yourself as well. All in all, playing into our "New Player Friendly" atmosphere.</p>
