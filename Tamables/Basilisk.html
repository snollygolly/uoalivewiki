<h1 style="text-align:center;">It has been said the Basilisk can be found in the colder, darker, damper parts of Sosaria.</h1>
<p style="text-align:center;">If you feel a shiver down your spine.. something isn't right! Or perhaps you are close!</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">This elusive creature is part of the esteemed Custom Tamables collection on UOAlive and can only be obtained by skillfully defeating hordes of fierce creatures and fearless protectors. Only the most tenacious players who successfully navigate through these challenges will have the chance to tame this prized creature, making it a true badge of honor among the taming community.</p>
